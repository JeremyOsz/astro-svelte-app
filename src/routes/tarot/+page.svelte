              The tarot's origins trace back to 15th century Italy, where the first known decks were created as playing cards. 
              The Major Arcana evolved from medieval allegorical imagery and Renaissance symbolism, incorporating elements from 
              Christian mysticism, classical mythology, and esoteric traditions.

            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
              The Major Arcana tells the story of "The Fool's Journey" - a metaphorical path of spiritual development. 
              Beginning with The Fool (0) representing innocence and new beginnings, the journey progresses through 
              various life experiences, challenges, and spiritual revelations, culminating in The World (21) representing 
              completion and wholeness.

              Throughout history, the Major Arcana has been associated with various mystical and philosophical traditions. 
              In the 18th and 19th centuries, occultists like Antoine Court de GÃ©belin and Ã‰liphas LÃ©vi connected the tarot 
              to ancient Egyptian wisdom and Kabbalistic teachings.

            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
              The Rider-Waite-Smith deck, published in 1909, revolutionized tarot interpretation by adding detailed symbolic 
              imagery to all 78 cards. Today, tarot serves as a powerful tool for self-reflection, spiritual guidance, and 
              psychological insight.
