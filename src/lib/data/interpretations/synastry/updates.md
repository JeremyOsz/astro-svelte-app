## Transformation Pattern

### Key Principles
1. **Remove formulaic repetition** - No more "Natural [context] [planet] [aspect]. Your [planet1] and [planet2] work together beautifully, creating effortless [quality] in [context] relationships."
2. **Create authentic, context-specific interpretations** - Each context (romance, friendship, family, business) should have genuinely different and meaningful descriptions
3. **Emphasize aspect-specific keywords**:
   - **Conjunction**: "instant recognition," "deep understanding," "intense connection," "profound bond"
   - **Trine**: "comfortable," "easy," "natural," "effortless," "harmonious"
   - **Square**: "challenging," "dynamic," "growth," "tension," "conflict resolution"
   - **Opposition**: "complementary," "balance," "polarity," "integration," "wholeness"
   - **Sextile**: "supportive," "opportunity," "gentle," "cooperative," "mutual benefit"
   - **Quincunx**: "awkward," "adjustment," "misalignment," "adaptation," "integration"
   - **Semi-square**: "minor tension," "irritation," "adjustment," "refinement"
   - **Sesquiquadrate**: "frustration," "square-like tension," "resolution needed"

### Transformation Process
1. **Read the current file** to understand the repetitive pattern
2. **Identify the aspect's core energy** and appropriate keywords
3. **Transform each planet combination** by:
   - Replacing formulaic sentences with authentic descriptions
   - Making each context genuinely different and meaningful
   - Using aspect-appropriate language and intensity
   - Maintaining astrological accuracy while improving readability
