1. **Start with the Big Three**: Focus on your Sun, Moon, and Ascendant first - these reveal your core personality, emotional nature, and how you present yourself.

2. **Look for Patterns**: Notice if you have many planets in certain signs or houses - this indicates areas of focus in your life.

3. **Check the Aspects**: Pay attention to major aspects (conjunctions, oppositions, squares, trines) as these show important dynamics in your personality.

4. **Consider the Houses**: Even if a house is empty, the sign on its cusp (boundary) shows how you approach that area of life.

5. **Explore Transits**: In transit charts, see how current planetary positions interact with your natal chart to understand current influences.
